README for dvdreadfs - mount dvd's using libdvdread
Sam Horrocks (sam@daemoninc.com) 2/11/2007

Description
-----------
Dvdreadfs is useful for making video dvds readable by any application
not just those that are linked already with libdvdread.  For example, I
use dvdreadfs to mount my dvd drive and then share that mount point over samba
to other computers.

Dvdreadfs will only keep the DVD device open while someone is using files in
its mount point so it's pretty safe to keep it mounted all the time.


Compiling and Installing
------------------------
You'll need fuse and the fuse-devel packages.  Once you have those, compile
dvdreadfs with "make".  To install the binary in /usr/bin do "make install".


Configuration
-------------
To make the files readable by everyone add to /etc/fuse.conf:
	user_allow_other

You can create a dvdreadfs mount using an fstab entry like:
	dvdreadfs#/dev/hdd	/mnt/dvd		fuse	ro,kernel_cache,allow_other 0 0

You may want to change /dev/hdd to your dvd device (/dev/dvd for example).


Advanced
--------
If you want to modify the IFO file before it's read by the user, use
 -DFIX_IFO to define a function that will fix up the .ifo data.  This
function will be passed the full contents of every ifo after it is read
from the dvd but before it's sent back to the user.


Patches
-------
apply the patches with the following commands
`patch -i 0001-Remove-read_ahead-caching.patch -l`
`patch -i 0002-Add-.volume_id-static-file-to-store-ISO-volume-name.patch -l`
